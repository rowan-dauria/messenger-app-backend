# messenger-app-backend

**(WIP)** This is the code running the backend of the messenger app. Because I'm learning new technologies as I go, I'm most concerned with getting them working rather than implementing the most optimised design patterns at the moment.

It uses a mix of REST api (express.js), with Websocket connections (socket.io) for instant messaging. The backend integrates with a Postgres database, will maybe expand this to use Redis in future.
