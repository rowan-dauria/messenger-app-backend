# messenger-app-backend

## (WIP)
Currently under development - This is the code running the backend of the messenger app. 

It uses a mix of REST api (express.js), with Websocket connections (socket.io) for instant messaging. The backend integrates with a Postgres database, will maybe expand this to use Redis in future.
